    "REST Architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "REST is a lightweight, flexible architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform operations on data resources. RESTful APIs are designed to be stateless, meaning that each request contains all the information necessary for the server to understand and respond to it. REST APIs use URLs to identify resources and return data in a variety of formats, such as JSON or XML.\n",

    "SOAP Architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP is a more complex architectural style that uses XML to structure data and send messages between applications. SOAP APIs use the HTTP protocol to transport messages and can be used with a variety of other transport protocols. SOAP defines a standardized message format and protocol for exchanging data, and supports advanced features such as encryption, authentication, and reliable messaging.\n",
