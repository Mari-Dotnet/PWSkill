    "13.what are the benefits of using python?\n",
    "Easy to learn: Python has a simple and intuitive syntax, making it easy for beginners to learn and get started with programming.\n",
    "Versatile: Python can be used for a wide range of tasks, including web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.\n",
    "Large community: Python has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development and provide support to others.\n",
    "Plenty of libraries: Python has a rich set of libraries and tools, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, and more, which makes it easy to perform complex tasks with little or no coding.\n",
    "Cross-platform compatibility: Python code can run on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it a great choice for developing cross-platform applications.\n",
    "Dynamically typed: Python is dynamically typed, which means that data types are determined at runtime, making it more flexible than statically typed languages.\n",
    "Easy to integrate: Python can be easily integrated with other programming languages, making it a great choice for integrating existing systems.\n",
    "Great for prototyping: Python's fast development cycle and ease of use make it a great choice for quickly prototyping ideas and experimenting with new concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. how is memory managed in python.\n",
    "memory management is handled automatically by the Python memory manager. The memory manager is responsible for allocating and freeing memory for Python objects, \n",
    "as well as handling other memory management tasks, such as garbage collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "15.how to install python on windows and set path variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the Python installer from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the installer and follow the instructions to complete the installation process. Make sure to check the \"Add Python to environment variables\" option during the installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the Command Prompt and type \"python\" to verify that the installation was successful. If the installation was successful, you should see the Python REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up the path variables, open the Start menu and search for \"Environment Variables\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In the System Properties window, click on the \"Environment Variables\" button.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Environment Variables window, scroll down to the \"System Variables\" section and find the \"Path\" variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on the \"Edit\" button, then click on the \"New\" button and add the path to the Python executable file, which is usually \"C:\\PythonXX\\python.exe\", where XX is the version number of Python installed on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on \"OK\" to close all windows and save the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Restart the Command Prompt and type \"python\" again. This time, you should see the Python REPL prompt, which indicates that the path variables have been set up correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you can successfully install Python on Windows and set up the path variables, allowing you to run Python from the Command Prompt or any other terminal.\n",
