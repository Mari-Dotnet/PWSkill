    "- The basic idea behind gradient descent is to take steps in the direction of the negative gradient of the function at each iteration. The negative gradient points in the direction of steepest descent, which means it guides the algorithm toward the minimum of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In terms of convergence speed, SGD and mini-batch GD often converge faster per iteration compared to BGD since they update the parameters more frequently. Momentum-based methods can further enhance convergence speed by accelerating the learning process in relevant directions."

    "- Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) optimizer is a popular optimization algorithm that combines the concepts of momentum and adaptive learning rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Advantages:\n",
    "    - Adam adjusts the learning rate for each parameter individually based on the historical first moment (mean) and second moment (variance) of the gradients. It adapts the learning rate according to the properties of each parameter rather than using a single learning rate for the entire model.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Adam does not require excessive memory. It only needs to maintain the moving averages of the first and second moments of the gradients for each parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Disadvantages:\n",
    "    - Although Adam is designed to be less sensitive to learning rate selection, it still requires careful tuning of hyperparameters.\n",
    "    - The adaptive learning rates and additional calculations for estimating moments introduce additional computational overhead compared to simpler optimization algorithms like SGD."
