    "#### Q4. How can time series forecasting be used in business decision-making, and what are some commonchallenges and limitations?\n",
    "- Data quality and availability: Accurate forecasting relies on high-quality data that is complete, consistent, and free from errors. In some cases, historical data may not be available or may be limited, making it difficult to build reliable forecasting models.\n",

    "- Complex patterns: Time series data can exhibit complex patterns, including multiple interacting factors, nonlinear relationships, or irregular fluctuations. Capturing and modeling such complexities can be challenging and may require advanced modeling techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assumptions of stationarity: Many traditional time series forecasting methods assume stationarity, meaning that statistical properties of the data remain constant over time. However, real-world time series often exhibit non-stationary behavior, requiring additional preprocessing or advanced modeling techniques."

    "- ARIMA model is defined as ARIMA(p, d, q). The parameters p, d, and q are determined based on the characteristics of the time series data and can be estimated using techniques such as autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plots.\n",

    "    - The x-axis represents the lags (time intervals) between observations.\n",
    "    - The y-axis represents the correlation coefficient, which indicates the strength and direction of the correlation.\n",

    "- The PACF plot shows the correlation between observations at different lags, excluding the indirect correlation through shorter lags. It helps in identifying the order of the Autoregressive (AR) component in the ARIMA model.\n",
    "    - The x-axis represents the lags (time intervals) between observations.\n",
    "    - The y-axis represents the partial correlation coefficient, which measures the correlation after removing the influence of shorter lags."

    "\n",
    "- Mean: In a stationary time series, the mean remains constant over time. It does not exhibit any significant trend or systematic patterns. In contrast, a non-stationary time series shows a changing mean, indicating a trend or drift in the data.\n",

    "- Variance: Stationary time series have constant variance throughout the time series. Non-stationary time series, especially those with a trend component, often have increasing or varying variance over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Autocovariance: Stationary time series have autocovariance that depends only on the time lag between observations and not on the specific time points. The autocovariance function remains relatively constant over time. In contrast, non-stationary time series exhibit autocovariance that varies with time, often showing a decreasing trend."
