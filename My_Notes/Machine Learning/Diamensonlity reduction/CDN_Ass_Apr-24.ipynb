    "#### Q2. How does the optimization problem in PCA work, and what is it trying to achieve?\n",
    "- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a common technique used for dimensionality reduction. It involves transforming the original features into a new set of uncorrelated features called principal components, which retain most of the variance in the original data.\n"
