    "- An eigenvector is a non-zero vector that, when multiplied by a square matrix, results in a scalar multiple of the original vector. This scalar multiple is called the eigenvalue. In other words, an eigenvector is a vector that is unchanged in direction when multiplied by a matrix, but may be scaled.\n",
