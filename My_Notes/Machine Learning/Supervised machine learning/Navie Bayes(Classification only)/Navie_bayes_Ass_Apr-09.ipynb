    "#### Q3. How is Bayes' theorem used in practice?\n",
    "- Machine Learning: Bayes' theorem is used in machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes classifiers. These algorithms use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that a new data point belongs to a particular class based on its features.\n",
    "- Spam Filtering: Bayes' theorem is used in spam filtering to determine the probability that an incoming email is spam based on its content. A spam filter assigns a score to each email based on how likely it is to be spam, and this score is calculated using Bayes' theorem."

    "\n",
    "- Gaussian Naive Bayes: This classifier assumes that the features are normally distributed. It is suitable for continuous data, where the features follow a Gaussian distribution. It is commonly used in problems such as image recognition, where the features are the pixel values of an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multinomial Naive Bayes: This classifier is suitable for discrete data, where the features represent the frequency of occurrence of certain events. It is commonly used in text classification, where the features are the word frequencies in a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bernoulli Naive Bayes: This classifier is similar to the multinomial Naive Bayes, but it assumes that the features are binary, i.e., they can take on only two values (0 or 1). It is commonly used in problems such as spam filtering, where the features represent the presence or absence of certain words in an email."
