    "#### Q1. What is the main difference between the Euclidean distance metric and the Manhattan distance metric in KNN? How might this difference affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Euclidean distance measures the straight-line distance between two points, taking into account the differences in their coordinates along each dimension. It can be visualized as the length of the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle formed by the two points and their perpendicular projections onto each axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Manhattan distance, on the other hand, measures the distance between two points as the sum of the absolute differences in their coordinates along each dimension. It can be visualized as the distance between the two points in a grid-like cityscape, where you can only travel along the streets and avenues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The choice of distance metric can have an impact on the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor. Euclidean distance is sensitive to the scale of the input features, as features with larger values will dominate the distance calculation. Therefore, it is important to scale the features before using Euclidean distance in KNN. Manhattan distance is not as sensitive to the scale of the input features, making it a better choice for datasets with features of different scales."

    "#### Q3. How does the choice of distance metric affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor? In what situations might you choose one distance metric over the other?\n",
    "- The choice of distance metric should be based on the characteristics of the data and the modeling task. In general, Euclidean distance may be more suitable for continuous data with a low number of dimensions, while Manhattan distance may be more suitable for discrete or sparse data with a high number of dimensions. However, it is important to experiment with different distance metrics and compare their performance to select the optimal one."

    "#### Q4. What are some common hyperparameters in KNN classifiers and regressors, and how do they affectthe performance of the model? How might you go about tuning these hyperparameters to improve model performance?\n",
    "- k: The number of nearest neighbors to consider. A higher k value can lead to a smoother decision boundary but may also increase bias, while a lower k value can increase variance and lead to overfitting.\n",

    "- Distance metric: The choice of distance metric used to calculate the distance between data points. Different distance metrics may be more suitable for different types of data or different modeling tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weighting: The weight assigned to each nearest neighbor in the prediction. Uniform weighting assigns equal weight to all nearest neighbors, while distance weighting assigns higher weight to closer neighbors.\n",

    "- Leaf size: The number of points at which the algorithm switches from brute-force search to tree-based search. A smaller leaf size may lead to faster searching but may also increase the risk of overfitting."

    "- The size of the training set can significantly impact the performance of a KNN model. While a larger training set can lead to better performance, it can also increase computational complexity and training time. Cross-validation, learning curves, sampling techniques, and feature selection can all be used to optimize the size of the training set for a KNN model.T"
