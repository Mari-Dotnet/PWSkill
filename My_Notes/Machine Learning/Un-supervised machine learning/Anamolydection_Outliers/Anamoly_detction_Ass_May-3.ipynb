    "- The LOF algorithm computes the local density of a data point by measuring the average distance between the point and its k nearest neighbours. This local density measure is known as the local reachability density (LRD) and is used to identify data points that have a significantly lower density than their neighbours."

    "- To detect global outliers using the Isolation Forest algorithm, the algorithm creates multiple random forests, and the average path length for each data point is calculated. Points with shorter average path lengths are considered to be more anomalous, while points with longer average path lengths are considered to be less anomalous. The threshold for what is considered anomalous can be adjusted based on the user's preference or domain knowledge."
