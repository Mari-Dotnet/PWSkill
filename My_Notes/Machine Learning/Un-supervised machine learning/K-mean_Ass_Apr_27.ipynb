    "Advantages of K-means clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scalability: K-means is computationally efficient and can handle large datasets with many variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simplicity: K-means is a simple and easy-to-understand algorithm that can be easily implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flexibility: K-means allows the user to choose the number of clusters (K) and the distance metric to use, giving the user flexibility in how they want to cluster their data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interpretability: K-means produces easily interpretable results since each cluster is represented by its mean or centroid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations of K-means clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sensitivity to initialization: K-means is sensitive to the initial placement of the cluster centroids, which can lead to different results for different initializations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Limited cluster shape flexibility: K-means assumes that the clusters are spherical and equally sized, which may not be true for all datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Outlier sensitivity: K-means is sensitive to outliers, which can significantly impact the clustering results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Requires prior knowledge of K: The user needs to have some prior knowledge about the number of clusters to choose (K), which may not always be known or obvious."

    "#### Q4. How do you determine the optimal number of clusters in K-means clustering, and what are some common methods for doing so?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Elbow method: This method involves plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (WSS) against the number of clusters (K) and selecting the value of K where the curve begins to level off or form an \"elbow.\" The idea is to choose the K value that results in a significant decrease in WSS while minimizing the number of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Silhouette method: This method involves calculating the silhouette coefficient for each data point in each cluster, which measures how similar a data point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. The overall silhouette score is then calculated for each value of K, and the value of K with the highest silhouette score is chosen. "
