    "- Homogeneity measures how pure clusters are with respect to a given ground truth, by computing the conditional entropy of the cluster labels given the true labels. A score close to 1 indicates highly homogeneous clusters, while a score close to 0 indicates low homogeneity.\n",
    "- Completeness measures how well all data points are assigned to clusters, with respect to a given ground truth, by computing the conditional entropy of the true labels given the cluster labels. A score close to 1 indicates highly complete clustering, while a score close to 0 indicates incomplete clustering."

    "- DBI is a useful metric for evaluating clustering algorithms, as it provides a quantitative measure of clustering quality that takes into account both the within-cluster and between-cluster distances. However, it should be used in conjunction with other evaluation metrics, as no single metric provides a complete picture of clustering quality."

    "- Yes, it is possible for a clustering result to have high homogeneity but low completeness. \n",
    "- Suppose we have a dataset of fruits that includes apples, oranges, and bananas. We want to cluster the fruits based on their color (red, orange, or yellow), and we know the ground truth labels for each fruit. Let's assume that a clustering algorithm produces two clusters, one containing all the red fruits (apples), and the other containing all the orange and yellow fruits (oranges and bananas). In this case, the homogeneity score would be high because all the apples are assigned to the same cluster, which corresponds to their ground truth class. However, the completeness score would be low because not all the oranges and bananas are assigned to the same cluster, as they belong to different ground truth classes."
