    "- Bootstrap is a resampling technique used to estimate the variability of a statistic from a single sample. The basic idea is to repeatedly sample from the original data with replacement to create multiple \"bootstrapped\" samples, and then calculate the statistic of interest (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) for each of these samples. The resulting distribution of bootstrapped statistics can then be used to estimate the sampling distribution of the statistic and to construct a confidence interval.\n",
