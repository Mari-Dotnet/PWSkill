    "\n",
    "##### Adbantages\n",
    "- Boosting can significantly improve the predictive performance of machine learning models compared to single models. \n",
    "- Boosting is versatile and can be applied to a wide range of machine learning tasks, including classification, regression, and ranking.\n",
    "- Boosting is resistant to overfitting because it combines many weak models into a strong one, which reduces the generalization error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitation:\n",
    "- Boosting can be sensitive to noisy data or outliers, which may lead to overfitting. Therefore, it requires careful preprocessing and outlier detection.\n",
    "- Boosting can be difficult to interpret because it combines many weak models into a complex one, making it hard to understand how the final predictions are made."

    "#### Q3. Explain how boosting works.\n",
    "- The key idea behind boosting is to create a strong predictor by combining many weak models, each of which focuses on different examples or aspects of the data. By iteratively adjusting the weights of the examples, boosting emphasizes the difficult examples that are misclassified by the current model, leading to a more accurate and robust predictor."

    "\n",
    "The algorithm then adjusts the weights of the examples in the training set based on the performance of the base model. Specifically, the weights of the misclassified examples are increased, and the weights of the correctly classified examples are decreased. This process focuses the attention of the next base model on the examples that were misclassified by the previous model.\n",

    "A new base model is trained on the modified dataset with updated example weights. This model is also a weak learner, but it should be better than the previous model at classifying the misclassified examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps 2 and 3 are repeated iteratively for a fixed number of iterations (or until a stopping criterion is met), with each new model trying to improve the predictions of the previous ones.\n",
    "\n",
